# PHP_English

This is the english version of my submission to the Semester Project.

In this version, i used PHP executed directly from the VSCode terminal to perform the CRUD functions in the table Dictionary.

It is a simple project of beginner difficulty which uses some native functions from PHP specific to MySQL DBMS, conditional statements and looping structures.

In the code docs you can find comments made by myself to help any possible reader.
