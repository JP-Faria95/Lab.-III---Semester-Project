Greetings. This is my submission to the semester project developed to the class "Database Development Laboratory III".
The main task of this project is to implement, using PHP language, the SQL Functions CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) into one database previously created using MySQL DBMS.
The proposal of the Database is to represent a Dictionary which holds 20 terms associated with another subjects from the current semester.
The Table Dictionary was created as follow:

ID (primary key and auto increment)
Term (the term itself)
Term(PT) (the term in portuguese translate)
Subject (associated with the term)
Application (practical definition)
For this project:

PHP 8.4.4 version.
SQL querys for MySQL 9.1 version.
Visual Studio Code 1.98.0 version.
VSCode Extensions: Composer; IntelliPHP; LiveServer; PHP; PHP Profiler.
All code files contain some comments made by myself to help readers. :)
Notes: This is a really simple project and naturally is considered as beginner difficulty.
